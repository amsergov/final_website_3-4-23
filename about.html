            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Andrew "Serge" Sergovic is an audio engineer, producer, and bassist hailing from the City of Brotherly Love. 
               Attending Loyola University New Orleans, Sergovic has become an active figure in the music community. 
               You can find Serge recording rappers to indie-folk rockers as a teachers assistant / student engineer in the studios, tracking bass guitar for local acts, or working one-on-one with artists, working to make their music reflect their message as best as possible.
